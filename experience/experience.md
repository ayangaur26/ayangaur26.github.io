## Experience

### 1. CAIDA - Software Development Intern
- Deployed a native Android app and reusable Android library enabling 100+ researchers to collect and
visualize traceroute data from mobile devices
- Integrated a C-based CLI tool (Scamper) via Android NDK and used Termux for TCP socket, enabling
native traceroute generation directly on mobile devices
- Streamlined release workflows using GitLab CI/CD and Package Registry, cutting deployment time by 90%
- Secured sensitive credentials with Android Keystore, removing hardcoded keys and remediating vulnerabilities
- Integrated LangSmith observability into CAIDA’s GenAI pipeline for tracing, debugging, and evaluation

### 2. [Junkyard Computing Project – Distributed Systems Engineer](https://github.com/AJ-RR/Junkyard-CSE237D)
- Implemented asynchronous job handling for a Go-based grading service for Gradescope assignments running on repurposed Pixel Fold phones
- Converted job flow to a goroutine-driven, non-blocking API with thread-safe state tracking, ensuring concurrency
- Wrote a self-persisting metrics module that records per-job and aggregate latency in JSON, surviving pod restarts
- Ensured cross-compilation and multi-arch Docker builds, rolling out images cluster-wide with zero downtime
- Hardened Kubernetes manifests for low-resource hardware (ephemeral-storage) to stop pod evictions during grading

### 3. American Express ML Intern
- Fine-tuned DeBERTa and DistilBERT models for sensitive data discovery and redaction, enhancing the detection and redaction of PII, PCI, and contextual data from large financial text datasets, achieving an accuracy of 79%
- Enhanced the dataset's consistency by overwriting it with proper classifications, using regex for accurate redaction validation and improving detection of incorrectly classified data by 30% with custom regex solutions
- Tackled challenges like over-redaction and false accuracy through iterative model refinements, tokenization updates, and advanced label alignment strategies
- Developed and optimized contextual NER techniques, achieving 76% precision and 72% recall

### 4. Kastner Research Group - Research Intern
- Developing Python wrappers for AMD AI Engine intrinsics, combining ML frameworks with hardware
- Created class-based abstractions to generate optimized GeMM and convolution kernels for Versal ACAP
- Working on graph-based model generation in hls4ml, analyzing the current pipeline for model translation

### 5. Image InfoSystems Computer Vision Intern
- Developed and trained high-performance computer vision models for OCR, mathematical symbol, and Russian character datasets, achieving 95% accuracy and reducing loss to under 5%
- Converted trained TensorFlow models to PyTorch using a custom ONNX conversion function, ensuring 100% retention of model accuracy and preventing data loss across frameworks
- Worked on a Bank Security Enhancement Project by working on computer vision solutions for cheque verification, increasing verification accuracy by 20%
- Completed Stanford deep learning courses available on YouTube, expanding knowledge of neural networks, CNNs, and deep learning architectures

### 6. Break Through Tech Machine Learning @ UCLA AI/ML Fellow
- Selected from 3000+ applicants, learnt data handling and preprocessing techniques, using Pandas for efficient data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, and Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization
- Developed proficiency in training machine learning models using scikit-learn. Achieved an average model accuracy of 92% across various datasets, with hyperparameter tuning increasing model performance by 15% on average
- Implemented a diverse range of models such as decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, ensemble methods, deep learning, and neural networks, gaining experience in model selection and reducing loss by 20% through effective model selection
- Created and evaluated various machine learning models weekly to ensure high performance on unseen data, consistently achieving over 85% accuracy in validation tests and reducing overfitting by implementing regularization techniquesn data

### 6. ITA Workshop App Developer
- Developed a mobile application using Flutter and Dart for an annual workshop on information technology
- Worked closely with Professor Alon Orlitsky as part of a two-person team, engaging in frequent communication
- Redesigned and tested the splash screen and other in-app features using emulators for both Android and iOS
- Worked on the deployment of the mobile application on the App Store and Play Store after development

### 7. Mathematics Undergraduate Instructional Assistant
